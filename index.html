            <p> 
                Hey! My name is Jahsper Harrell, and I'm currently a student at the University of Utah Professional Education
                for a coding bootcamp. I am 19 years old and just graduated from Box Elder High School. During my time at Box Elder,
                I finished my engineering pathway and completed a few computer science courses as well. During the engineering pathway,
                some of the many tasks we needed to complete were, building and programming robots to sumo fight, building and programming conveyor belts 
                to transfer materials, building and programming a machine to sort marbles of varying sizes, and colors, and programming a 
                industrial size robotic arm to make and serve popcorn throughout the day. I also have multiple years of customer service work under
                my belt. I'm currently very excited for the oportunities that await me as a result of this coding bootcamp, and am extremely eager
                to dive into the tech industry.
            </p>
